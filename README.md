•	Create realistic API.<br />
<br />
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a html output regarding the Domestic Market (Contract) Mix Color HDPE resin forecasting prediction in cents per pound. The training dataset includes HDPE resin costs in cents per pound from Jan-2016 to Sep-2021. Thus, the outputs should include predictions of Oct-2021, Nov-2021 and Dec-2021. 

We will create a prediction ML model to predict the HDPE resin costs of the next three months. After storing the batch output result in Big Query, we can clone Github source including Flask, Static CSS file, Template image file, etc.

With Goodle Cloud Platform, I will build the data engineering pipelines as per below:
